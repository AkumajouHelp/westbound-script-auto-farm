# Westbound Auto Farm Script (Arceus X Neon Android Compatible)

A full-featured, optimized auto farm script for **Roblox: Westbound**, designed for **Android users** using **Arceus X Neon**. This script automatically farms coyotes, auto-sells items, kills nearby enemies with kill aura, equips the best weapon, and prevents getting kicked for being AFK and more.

## ‚úÖ Features
- **Auto Farm**: Automatically targets and kills coyotes, making farming efficient and effortless.
- **Auto Sell**: Automatically sells items when near the merchant, ensuring that the player's inventory is always optimized.
- **Ammo Management**: The script checks the player's inventory and automatically switches weapons when ammo is depleted.
- **Kill Aura**: Automatically kills enemies within a specified range of the player, making it easier to clear out threats.
- **ESP for Enemies**: Highlights enemies with a visual marker, making it easier to locate and eliminate them.
- **Anti-AFK**: Prevents the player from being kicked for inactivity by simulating mouse input.
- **Coyote Respawn Tracker**: Monitors coyotes' respawn times and notifies the player when a coyote has respawned.
- **Simple GUI**: Features a toggle button for starting and stopping the auto-farming process with ease.
- **Notifications**: Provides notifications for important events such as defeating a coyote, selling items, or when a coyote respawns.
- **GUI Auto Hide on Death:** Automatically hides the in-game GUI when the player dies and respawns. This helps maintain a cleaner UI during gameplay, ensuring the interface is not visible during the respawn process. The GUI will be re-enabled when the player starts interacting again.
